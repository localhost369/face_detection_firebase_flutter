# Face Detection Firebase Flutter
Firebase face detection from galley or Camera live image on flutter framework.

In this project I have implemented the custom painter illustrated in the last video released by Flutter Team:: [Custom painting in Flutter - Flutter In Focus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvI_NUXK00s&t=4s).
